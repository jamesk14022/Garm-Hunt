		<p className="article-pretext">Corporate bootlegging is the art of satirising big, household brands through small label 
		fashion. Bootlegging has been around for decades, but corporate bootlegging is a relatively new phenomenon. Vetements famously brought this trend into the limelight with 
		its Â£185 DHL tee - a polarising piece, either mocked or adored by critics. Christoper Shannon's famous SS17 collection hatersdirect and loversdirect plays on the same theme
		, taking inspiration from the popular high street retailer Sportsdirect. Below is a selection of pieces on this theme by small UK labels, we think you'll recognise some familar brands. A personal 
		favourite of ours is the IKEA inspired bucket hat.</p>
