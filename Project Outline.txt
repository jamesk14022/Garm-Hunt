A service for discovering and sharing small fashion brands.

Globablisation and web technology have made starting a fashion brand in 2018 easier than ever before.
We want to capitalise on this by helping people find interesting clothes from small labels they wouldnt 
otherwise find.

My target market is 18-25 yo fashion conscious and liberal men(possible exapansion or pivot to target women might be the next move),
possibly better suited to target men in the US.

Building this site also should help me cement what I have so far learned about the react framework. Also gaining experience in APIs and
building with mobile capability in mind. 

Traction Plan - Do things that dont scale
scour lookbooks and similar sources for more content for the site
write an interesting feature article for the homepage
curate 1 collection for the homepage
1 more feature ??

its important to remembver that the value users get from the service is directly correlated with the number
of good outfits on the platform

post interesting outfits in relevant subreddits
email brand owners and get them to submit outfits from their collections
try to get media attention somehow
